# Spacestagram

This project was done for a frontend developer intern challenge at Shopify for my application.
This mobile-friendly app displays photos from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API on a social-media-like platform.
Users can like/unlike photos and use a datepicker to specify the range of dates that they want to see photos of.
The default screen displays today's image only.
While users wait for NASA's API to return data, the app displays a fun animated loading screen so that the app remains interactive to the user even when the page is loading.
